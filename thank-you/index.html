        My dearest friends, I'm leaving Microsoft on 7/18 for school (Media Lab at MIT, see forwarded message). You are receiving this special email because
        you've left a lasting impact in my last 10 years at work. Please accept my heartfelt gratitude:
      </p>
      <p>
        Irina, Sharath, Chris Chua, Neil, Shay, Zhongwei, Jesse, Matt Menzer, Zach, Matt Duignan, John, Quirine- You are the best managers. Many of you took a leap of faith, making
        space for someone who didn't fit elsewhere to thrive on your teams. Thank you for giving me the freedom to break rules and forge my own path.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nick, Jon, Jonah, Joe, Cary, Asha - I'm incredibly fortunate to have had you as my leaders, elevating my work and creating opportunities for me to make
        meaningful impact. You are literally the executive sponsor of my career!
      </p>
      <p>
        Carter, Diego, Denesh, Jiaye, Yilei, Chris Caruso - Each of you shaped my career at pivotal moments in profound ways. You selflessly shared your time and
        wisdom. You not only gave me the courage to blaze my own path but also embodied your values in the work you do. Your legacy is the principles I live by
        today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lauren, Peter, Henry - We helped each other navigate challenges at work and in life. Thank you for always challenging me to think clearer, walk the
        walk, and never give up on quality and craft.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adam, Abdulfatai, Niduan, Ben, Lenny, Theresa, Waseem, Veronica, Ikuyo, Owen, Will - You stood out as my extraordinary coworkers. I learned so much from
        watching you work. Each of you demonstrated the highest level of mastery in your disciplines and reminded me to never stop learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Casey, Xuechen - The best way to code into the wee hours is doing it with friends who share your passion for hacking. The two Hackathons I ran with you
        were the most memorable and fun!
      </p>
      <p>
        Jeff, Greg, Ross, Krishna, Sridhar, Gantaphon, Will, Brittany - From coffee club to lunches to hangouts outside of work, you made the workplace feel
        like home. Thank you for sharing my best joys as well as putting up with my worst shenanigans. Work is fun because of you!
      </p>
      <p>
        And many others who have journeyed with me - you will continue to inspire. Thank you and stay in touch! Please find me on
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chuanqi-sun/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or follow my latest learning in my
        <a href="https://blog.chuanqisun.com" target="_blank">technical blog</a>.

      <p>FORWARDED MESSAGE</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Hi friends,</p>
        <p>
          AI engineering is moving fast. Working at Azure AI Foundry has given me a lot to think about, and I want to take what I‚Äôve learned here and go
          deeper‚Äîespecially into the philosophical side of things. I‚Äôm interested in how humans and AI relate, how carbon-based and silicon-based life forms
          interact, and how computation can express empathy through art.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that in mind, I applied to the Media Arts and Sciences program at MIT last winter. I got in, and with the school year about to begin, it's time
          for me to pack up for my move to Boston - my last day at work will be 7/18.
        </p>
        <p>
          It‚Äôs not easy to leave. The computational design discipline here is finally coming into its own. I never thought I‚Äôd see the day when designers and
          developers on the same team would work side by side on the same projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my happiest moments was seeing so many of you try out vibe coding and share your projects. I hope you felt that spark of joy when your code
          first came live in the browser. That was the very reason why I'm still coding every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I‚Äôve never seen the kind of growth and impact that our team has achieved, anywhere else in my career. I think this is one of the best places to be at
          Microsoft. Knowing I‚Äôll miss out on what comes next is not easy. Part of me is wanting to hang around just a bit longer so I can build more tools and
          experiences to transform how we design and build with AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          But change is part of life. Small changes happen all the time; big ones come only a few times. This is one of the big ones for me. I‚Äôm making this
          move with a lot of gratitude towards everyone who‚Äôs helped me, from my first intern manager ten years ago to Everyone reading this now. You‚Äôre part of
          my experience here, and I‚Äôm just thankful for sharing this experience with you.
        </p>
        <p>I wish you new adventures ahead and godspeed on transforming civilization with technology.</p>
