- Notes
  - Original artwork combines structure with randomness
  - There appears to be a 1,2,4 column layout governing the vertical rhythm
  - Perlin noise applied to the length varition as we render from top to bottom
  - A lot of manual parameter tweaking until the dense-sparse-dense-empty-dense-sparse-dense rhythm felt right
  - Vibe coded [a tool](https://code.chuanqisun.com/color-analyzer/) to extract color palette from any image
