      <h1>Life Choice Live: Decisions as Breaking News</h1>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Life Choice Live turns a hard personal choice into a live news experience. The system simulates alternative paths as short news packages with anchors,
        field reports, street interviews, timelines, and graphics you can experience in front of a physical TV set. It blends user provided context with
        generative media to make tradeoffs and second order effects concrete without telling people what to do. The aim is better reflection, clearer values,
        and more confident choices for life events such as moving, changing jobs, or ending relationships. We will build a gallery scale installation, run a
        pilot study on decision clarity and confidence, and release open tools that support safe use of simulated media for personal reflection.
      </p>
      <h2>Main idea</h2>
      <p>
        People struggle to reason about the downstream effects of big choices. Text lists and pro con tables are abstract. News style narratives are concrete
        and easy to grasp. The main idea is to render future scenarios as short news segments that update as you explore alternative decisions. This format can
        surface tradeoffs you would otherwise miss. It can help you relate to your future self and community impact without pressure or prescription.
      </p>
      <h2>What we will build</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Timeline builder. An algorithm that turns a user described decision into a branching graph of outcomes over weeks, months, and one to two years. Nodes
          contain facts, assumptions, and prompts. Edges encode second order effects.
        </li>
        <li>
          News package generator. Templates for headlines, lower thirds, tickers, and split screens. A script orchestrates voice over, b roll, and graphics
          including realistic street interviews with generated personas and sensational newsroom situations that dramatize decision outcomes. We use a mix of
          template video, generative stills, and stylized animations to keep cost and risk low.
        </li>
        <li>
          Interactive installation. A 2x2 grid of vintage CRT-style monitors creates a retro newsroom aesthetic. Each screen shows a different timeline branch
          or deep dive panel. People navigate with a chunky wireless remote that matches the retro vibe. An operator computer sits nearby for session management
          and troubleshooting.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Methods and approach</h2>
      <h3>Study design and evaluation methods</h3>
      <p>
        We will evaluate Life Choice Live through two complementary approaches that focus on understanding how people interact with simulated futures and
        whether this format helps with decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Interaction studies with colleagues</strong> We'll start with small sessions where colleagues use the system while thinking aloud. This helps us
        refine the pacing, screen layout, story length, and remote controls before wider testing. We'll observe how people navigate between different timeline
        branches and what feels natural or confusing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Decision-making pilot study</strong> We'll run a study with 30 participants who each try two approaches to thinking through a personal decision:
        traditional written reflection and a Life Choice Live session. We'll measure whether the news format helps people feel more confident about their
        choice, better understand tradeoffs, and connect with their future self. We'll also test if people remember second-order effects better after seeing
        them as news stories.
      </p>
      <h3>Media generation and installation engineering</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Story synthesis: An LLM creates a scenario graph and beat outlines from user inputs. A content filter enforces tone and safety rules. A templater maps
          beats to news formats.
        </li>
        <li>Audio: High quality TTS produces anchor and reporter voices. We apply a consistent sonic identity and pace values to avoid sensational affect.</li>
        <li>Visuals: Generated video footage creates news-style b-roll with a cinéma vérité aesthetic, complemented by icon animations and data graphics.</li>
        <li>Rendering: A local PC synchronizes audio, video, and graphics across tiles or projector.</li>
        <li>Controls: Chunky wireless remote for user navigation and timeline switching.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Expected outcomes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A working installation that renders branching news style futures from user inputs.</li>
        <li>Initial quantitative signals of reduced decisional conflict and increased tradeoff awareness compared to written reflection.</li>
        <li>Qualitative insights on how people relate to second order effects and future self when outcomes feel concrete.</li>
        <li>Open source templates for scenario graphs, news package layout, disclosure overlays, and safety prompts.</li>
        <li>A short paper or demo submission to HCI venues.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Contribution to AHA: AI for human flourishing</h2>
      <p>
        Life Choice Live advances human flourishing by helping people reason about important life choices with more clarity and care. It uses AI to translate
        abstract futures into understandable narratives while centering agency, consent, and transparency. It offers an installation for public engagement, a
        pathway to publishable studies, and open components others can adapt for coaching and civic contexts.
      </p>
      <h2>Brief timeline</h2>
      <p>Weeks 1 to 2</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Finalize storyboard, safety policies, disclosure language, and tone guides. Select rendering stack. Submit IRB. Source displays and mounts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Weeks 3 to 5</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Build scenario graph builder and news package generator. Implement disclosure overlays, watermarks, and filters. Create initial b roll sets and
          graphics.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Weeks 6 to 7</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Internal sessions for interaction polish. Tune pacing, UI, and data panels. Prepare installation rig and operator console.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Weeks 8 to 9</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pilot study with N = 30. Collect measures. Analyze preregistered metrics.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Weeks 10 to 11</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Public installation sessions. Gather short exit surveys and observations. Iterate templates as needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Week 12</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Package open source release and write a short paper or demo submission. Produce a short video.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Risks and mitigations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          False realism and false memory. Use stylized visuals, constant simulated labels, and a facts panel. Avoid photorealistic faces and exact likenesses.
        </li>
        <li>Over persuasion. Keep a neutral tone. Present multiple branches and reflective prompts. No recommendations.</li>
        <li>Privacy. Default to local processing. Do not store personal media. Log only consented events.</li>
        <li>Cost and compute. Favor templates and stylized animation. Reuse b roll. Cache assets.</li>
        <li>Accessibility. Reduced motion mode, captions, clear type, and color safe palettes.</li>
        <li>Hardware availability. Prefer projector based layout. Borrow or rent displays if needed. Provide a single screen fallback layout.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Deliverables</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Installation software and templates with disclosure overlays and safety filters.</li>
        <li>Scenario graph builder and operator console.</li>
        <li>Open source assets: graphics package, prompt templates, and example datasets.</li>
        <li>Study protocol, analysis scripts, and a short paper or demo submission.</li>
      </ul>
